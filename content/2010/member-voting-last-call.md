The proxy voting still has not reached a quorom, so unless you plan on voting at the meeting you have until the close of business on December 14th. On December 15th we will have one of the few required "all hands" meetings to formally approve the voting results. The voting is handled by the XSF's Membership Bot [memberbot@jabber.org](xmpp:memberbot@jabber.org) and you can review the current membership applications listed here: [November 2010 Applications](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Membership_Applications_November_2010) The meeting particulars are: Date: 2010-12-15 Time: 20:00 UTC Location: xsf@muc.xmpp.org [Convert UTC times to your local time](http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx?y=2010&mo=12&d=15&h=20&mn=00) If you have any questions or problems voting, please contact Alexander Gnauck via email or IM.
